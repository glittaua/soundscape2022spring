For my audio narrative, I want to take people to a different world. The genre will most likely be sci-fi or fantasy. The story will be set on a planet that is under attack. Using different sound effects I will create the different environments of being on a ship or in the midst of a battle. Sounds to create environments will include battlefield ambiance, running on metal, multiple layers of chatter, and typical sounds you would hear on a spaceship. For the battle environment, I will use battlefield ambiance, gunfire, explosions, etc. I plan for there to be at least 4 unique characters that will be voiced by me and my roommates. The story will take start on the ship and then go down to the surface of the planet where you will be immersed in the mission as the elite soldiers fight to complete it. It will be fast-paced and I also may add background music to make it a little more dramatic. 
(I may possibly due a fantasy story instead of sci fi but I am leaning towards sci-fi)
