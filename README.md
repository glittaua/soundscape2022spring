**Project 1: Audio Narrative**

For this audio narrative the scene starts in space and ends in the ground. You start off with Captian Tharpe in space as he enters his daily log when suddenly ships start to attack the planet. Immediately everyone mobilizes for combat. The main characters you follow throughout the story are Fireteam Hades consisting of Vayne, Cloe, and Kingsley. They descend to the planet's surface to eliminate the artillery platforms. Descending to the planet you will hear various explosions and rattling. While on the surface the sounds of battle can be heard as well as dialogue between the fireteam members. 

All sounds and their sources can be found in Sound Assets.md
